# Simple-Face-Recognition-Program
KNU MIT Group 1

To run with interface run 'Start_interface.py' file.

This program can find faces on photos and compare them to known.

CREATING KNOWN FOLDER

Just put all photos with names in some folder, default is ./known_pictures (photos from subfolders are also read) and set path to this folder in Folder line.

Or if you don't like interface create FaceRecogniser object specifying folder path.
